# Reinforcement Learning Basics On Python

My goal is implementation of basic reinforcement learning algorithms in Python complete with explanations and illustrations.

In these Jupiter notebooks, I tried to make an implementation of the topics from the Sutton-Barto book [Reinforcement Learning:
An Introduction](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/assets/files/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf).

Some topics are accompanied by quotes and illustrations from the book, as well as my own comments (to the best of my understanding of the topic).

The work is currently ongoing and three workbooks are available:

## [K-armed Bandit](https://github.com/denisgriaznov/ReinforcementLearningBasicsOnPython/blob/master/1.%20K-armed%20Bandit.ipynb)
## [Bellman equations](https://github.com/denisgriaznov/ReinforcementLearningBasicsOnPython/blob/master/2.%20Bellman%20equations.ipynb)
## [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/denisgriaznov/ReinforcementLearningBasicsOnPython/blob/master/3.%20Dynamic%20Programming.ipynb)
